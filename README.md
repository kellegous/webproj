# webproj - personal automation for a webpack/tsc project

I don't like webpack but it has become the de-facto standard for building frontend projects, TypeScript projects in particular. Every time I start something new, remembering how I strung together the shoe strings in the last project is annoying. This project just automates this periodic annoyance in my life. That's it, you can safely ignore it.
